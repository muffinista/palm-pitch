Pitch for the Palm Pilot, by Colin Mitchell

Years ago, I implemented a version of the card game 'Pitch', also known as
'Setback' for the Palm OS.  The game (like the platform), has
stagnated over the years, but was always reasonably popular, and I am
very happy with it.  I haven't sold a copy in over a year, and I
always though about releasing the code, so as of now, the code is open
sourced under the MIT license:

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/MIT/


The code compiles under CodeWarrior, which I don't even have a copy of
anymore.  Perhaps some enterprising hacker can use the code to get it
running elsewhere.

The supplied icon is a generic template, supplying a black or blue disc with
a stylus, similar to the default icon used by Palm OS for applications without
icons.  We have provided this as a starting point for your own icon efforts.
